This is a video format converter. It converts mp4 videos into HSL format for HTTP streaming.

Thank you for visiting my page :)

[[[[[ TO PREVIEW THE APLICATION, PLEASE GO TO THE "PROOF" DIRECTORY OF THIS REPOSITORY ]]]]

NOTE : If while running the application, if the application sometime doesn't work, just go the view tab and click on reload.
If still not working, feel free to contact me personally.

There are a few easy steps you will need to follow to start using this application. This whole process is a 4 step mechanism.

Step 1 : Clone this repoisitory to your device.
Step 2 : Since there is server, react app and electron js app in the same folder. There are three different package.json also.
So open the command terminal and write : 

Step 2a: 
i. --> npm i

then, after that write : 

Step 2b :
i. --> cd ..
ii. --> cd ffmpeg 
iii. --> npm i

then after that write : 
i. --> cd ..
ii. --> cd front
iii. --> npm i
vi. cd ..

And the difficult part is over. Now you only have one code remaining to start the "electron js video-formate-converter" !!

Step 4 and the last code : npm run dev.

CONGRATULATIONS ON REACHING OVER HERE ! I really hope you like my application. 

Thank you again 
Cheers

This will open the local host enivronment required to run the ffmpeg and the electron js which is based on react app.
